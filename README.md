# NovaFSW
This repo houses the flight software for Project Nova. 

Nova is a a vertical takeoff and landing vehicle that is powered by an electric ducted
fan and uses a gimbaled nozzle for thrust vectoring. I am building this lander to use as a testbed for
advanced GNC algorithms. My endgoal is to recreate JPL's G-FOLD algorithm and conduct a similar flight to 
Masten Xombie's Diversion test (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzHaWc5n70A). I am working on a 6DOF simulation
recreating G-Fold for my final project for ECE5555 Stochastic Controls and Estimation.
